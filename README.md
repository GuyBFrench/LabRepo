Joint Hierarchy
    This character is a scientist I created for my animation projects.
    I followed standard human joint hierarchy as best I could in creating her.
    I did not have any special considerations when making this character.

Procedural Modeiling Houdini

    Using a user input curve as a base create plane to define the shape and size of a level
    Create points a equal distances along all edges
    Copy premade geometry to the points to fill in the walss and ceiling of the level based on point position in the level
